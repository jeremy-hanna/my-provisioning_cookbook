# my-provisioning_cookbook
This repo is to house a cookbook to quickly configure and setup any Linux distro with specific applications, dotfiles, and just overall tools that I prefer to use when doing development work. It is currently under development.

##TODO (in no particular order)
* dotfile clone and copy from repo (this would probably be done last so it would not be overwritten by all the dependecies)
* development repo's clone
* git
* zsh 
  * zplug (the zsh package manager)
  * oh-my-zsh
* tmux
* vim (maybe NeoVim?)
  * vim-plug
* version managers
  * RUBY: chruby + ruby-install + ruby
    * bundler
    * rspec
  * PYTHON: virtualenv + python
  * NODE: nvm + node (you never know haha)
* postgres
* virtualbox
* vagrant
* spotify
* f.lux or equivalent
* caffeine or equivalent
* a better terminal (iTerm2 or Guake?)
* Firefox + bookmarks + extensions
* karabiner
